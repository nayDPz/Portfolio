A showcase of what I'm most proud of from the past 3.5 years I've spent modding ROR2. I've done mostly solo projects, but have spent the last year and a half working with the [Starstorm 2 team](https://github.com/TeamMoonstorm/Starstorm2).

For the creation of content, I use [Thunderkit](https://github.com/PassivePicasso/ThunderKit), an editor extension designed to closely replicate the standard Unity game workflow.

In that time, I've also gained the experience to do the animation, sound design, and visual effects for almost everything showcased here.
# Survivors
## Dancer
Solo project. The key feature is her primary, which changes its attack based on where you aim.

## Nemesis Mercenary
My first contribution to Starstorm 2. Sort of like Mercenary, but with a "manual" Eviscerate
